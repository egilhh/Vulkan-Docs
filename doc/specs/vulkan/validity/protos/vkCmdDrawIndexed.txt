Valid Usage
-----------
endif::doctype-manpage[]
* pname:commandBuffer must: be a valid sname:VkCommandBuffer handle
* pname:commandBuffer must: be in the recording state
* The sname:VkCommandPool that pname:commandBuffer was allocated from must: support graphics operations
* This command must: only be called inside of a render pass instance
* For each set _n_ that is statically used by the sname:VkPipeline currently bound to ename:VK_PIPELINE_BIND_POINT_GRAPHICS, a descriptor set must: have been bound to _n_ at ename:VK_PIPELINE_BIND_POINT_GRAPHICS, with a sname:VkPipelineLayout that is compatible for set _n_, with the sname:VkPipelineLayout used to create the current sname:VkPipeline, as described in <<descriptorsets-compatibility>>
* For each push constant that is statically used by the sname:VkPipeline currently bound to ename:VK_PIPELINE_BIND_POINT_GRAPHICS, a push constant value must: have been set for ename:VK_PIPELINE_BIND_POINT_GRAPHICS, with a sname:VkPipelineLayout that is compatible for push constants, with the sname:VkPipelineLayout used to create the current sname:VkPipeline, as described in <<descriptorsets-compatibility>>
* Descriptors in each bound descriptor set, specified via fname:vkCmdBindDescriptorSets, must: be valid if they are statically used by the currently bound sname:VkPipeline object, specified via fname:vkCmdBindPipeline
* All vertex input bindings accessed via vertex input variables declared in the vertex shader entry point's interface must: have valid buffers bound
* For a given vertex buffer binding, any attribute data fetched must: be entirely contained within the corresponding vertex buffer binding, as described in <<fxvertex-input>>
* A valid graphics pipeline must: be bound to the current command buffer with ename:VK_PIPELINE_BIND_POINT_GRAPHICS
* If the sname:VkPipeline object currently bound to ename:VK_PIPELINE_BIND_POINT_GRAPHICS requires any dynamic state, that state must: have been set on the current command buffer
* (pname:indexSize * (pname:firstIndex + pname:indexCount) + pname:offset) must: be less than or equal to the size of the currently bound index buffer, with indexSize being based on the type specified by pname:indexType, where the index buffer, pname:indexType, and pname:offset are specified via fname:vkCmdBindIndexBuffer
* Every input attachment used by the current subpass must: be bound to the pipeline via a descriptor set
* If any sname:VkSampler object that is accessed from a shader by the sname:VkPipeline currently bound to ename:VK_PIPELINE_BIND_POINT_GRAPHICS uses unnormalized coordinates, it mustnot: be used to sample from any sname:VkImage with a sname:VkImageView of the type ename:VK_IMAGE_VIEW_TYPE_3D, ename:VK_IMAGE_VIEW_TYPE_CUBE, ename:VK_IMAGE_VIEW_TYPE_1D_ARRAY, ename:VK_IMAGE_VIEW_TYPE_2D_ARRAY or ename:VK_IMAGE_VIEW_TYPE_CUBE_ARRAY, in any shader stage
* If any sname:VkSampler object that is accessed from a shader by the sname:VkPipeline currently bound to ename:VK_PIPELINE_BIND_POINT_GRAPHICS uses unnormalized coordinates, it mustnot: be used with any of the SPIR-V `OpImageSample*` or `OpImageSparseSample*` instructions with code:ImplicitLod, code:Dref or code:Proj in their name, in any shader stage
* If any sname:VkSampler object that is accessed from a shader by the sname:VkPipeline currently bound to ename:VK_PIPELINE_BIND_POINT_GRAPHICS uses unnormalized coordinates, it mustnot: be used with any of the SPIR-V `OpImageSample*` or `OpImageSparseSample*` instructions that includes a lod bias or any offset values, in any shader stage
* If the <<features-features-robustBufferAccess,robust buffer access>> feature is not enabled, and any shader stage in the sname:VkPipeline object currently bound to ename:VK_PIPELINE_BIND_POINT_GRAPHICS accesses a uniform buffer, it mustnot: access values outside of the range of that buffer specified in the currently bound descriptor set
* If the <<features-features-robustBufferAccess,robust buffer access>> feature is not enabled, and any shader stage in the sname:VkPipeline object currently bound to ename:VK_PIPELINE_BIND_POINT_GRAPHICS accesses a storage buffer, it mustnot: access values outside of the range of that buffer specified in the currently bound descriptor set
* Any slink:VkImage being sampled with ename:VK_FILTER_LINEAR as a result of this command must: be of a format which supports linear filtering, as specified by the ename:VK_FORMAT_FEATURE_SAMPLED_IMAGE_FILTER_LINEAR_BIT flag in sname:VkFormatProperties::pname:linearTilingFeatures returned by fname:vkGetPhysicalDeviceFormatProperties
