* pname:sType must: be ename:VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_BUFFER_MEMORY_BARRIER
* pname:pNext must: be `NULL`
* pname:srcAccessMask must: be a valid combination of elink:VkAccessFlagBits values
* pname:dstAccessMask must: be a valid combination of elink:VkAccessFlagBits values
* pname:buffer must: be a valid sname:VkBuffer handle
* pname:offset must: be less than the size of pname:buffer
* If pname:size is not equal to ename:VK_WHOLE_SIZE, pname:size must: be greater than `0`
* If pname:size is not equal to ename:VK_WHOLE_SIZE, pname:size must: be less than or equal to than the size of pname:buffer minus pname:offset
* If pname:buffer was created with a sharing mode of ename:VK_SHARING_MODE_CONCURRENT, pname:srcQueueFamilyIndex and pname:dstQueueFamilyIndex must: both be ename:VK_QUEUE_FAMILY_IGNORED
* If pname:buffer was created with a sharing mode of ename:VK_SHARING_MODE_EXCLUSIVE, pname:srcQueueFamilyIndex and pname:dstQueueFamilyIndex must: either both be ename:VK_QUEUE_FAMILY_IGNORED, or both be a valid queue family (see <<devsandqueues-queueprops>>)
* If pname:buffer was created with a sharing mode of ename:VK_SHARING_MODE_EXCLUSIVE, and pname:srcQueueFamilyIndex and pname:dstQueueFamilyIndex are valid queue families, at least one of them must: be the same as the family of the queue that will execute this barrier
